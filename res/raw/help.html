  <h2>Dictionary manager</h2>
  This screen lists all the available and installed dictionaries.
  <ul>
    <li> Click a dictionary to download or open it.
    <li> Long-click on a dictionary to move it to the top of the list or delete it.
  </ul>

  <h2>Dictionary</h2>
  This screen shows dictionary entries.  This is a massive list that you can
  scroll all the way through, or you can type in the search text to jump 
  there in the list.  Entries in the list are filed in multiple places,
  under all the relevant words.
  <h3>Searching</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> Type a single word to search for it.  QuickDic searches as you type, 
         jumping to the relevant position in the list.
    <li> (NEW) Type multiple words separated by spaces.  QuickDic finds all 
         the rows containing all of the words and displays them.
    <li> QuickDic tries to sort words using a romanized transliteration, 
         so you can try searching for non-Latin words using the Latin alphabet.
    <li> If the search text box isn't focused, you can start typing and its 
         contents will be replaced.
  </ul>
  <h3>Tricks</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> Click the button to the right of the search box to switch dictionary directions: EN-&gt;DE to DE-&gt;EN.
    <li> (NEW) Long-click the button to the right of the search box to pick a new dictionary.
    <li> Long-click any entry to bring up the context menu, from which you can:
    <ul>
      <li> (NEW) Long-click a particular word to jump to that word in the 
           dictionary.  This is a great way to quickly lookup words that
           are part of definitions (especially if they're in a language that's
           tough to type in!)
      <li> Add the current row to the wordList.txt file for later study.
      <li> Copy the current row to the clipboard.
    </ul>
    <!-- Long-click in the search text to open the search history. -->
