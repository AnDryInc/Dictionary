  Thanks for updating to QuickDic 3.1.
  <p> New features:
  <ul>
    <li> Search for multiple words at once (separated by spaces).
    <li> All words are hyperlinks: long-press any word in a dictionary to lookup that word.
    <li> Easier dictionary switching: long-press the switch-language button.
    <li> New English dictionaries: Azeri, Basque, Breton, Burmese, Faroese, Galician, Georgian, Haitian Creole, Luxembourgish, Macedonian, Tagalog, Urdu. (from enwiktionary.com data).
    <li> All dictionaries updated (mostly with better formatting), and can be re-downloaded at your leisure (previously downloaded dictionaries will still work).
  </ul>
