Thanks for updating to QuickDic 3.1.

<li>All words are hyperlinks: long-press any word in a dictionary
to lookup that word.</li>
<li>Easier dictionary switching: long-press the switch-language
button.</li>
<li>New English dictionaries: Azeri, Basque, Breton, Burmese,
Faroese, Galician, Georgian, Haitian Creole, Luxembourgish,
Macedonian, Tagalog, Urdu. (from enwiktionary.com data).</li>
<li>All dictionaries updated (mostly with better formatting), and
